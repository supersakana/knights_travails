A line between 2 people means that they know each other.

A social network is an example of a graph,
(people -> vertices, line -> edge)

Sometimes, we out numberic values on edges
Example. (destination -> vertice, miles -> edge)

A graph where the edges have weights (metrics) is a "weighted graph"

A directed edge leaves one vertex and enters the next

What is a graph? - An abstract data type in CS that has an entire field of study associated with it, called graph theory.

2 types of Graphs...

Directed Graph - One whose edges have direction, can often be one or 2 ways

Undirected Graph - Edges have no direction

Cycles - exist when the first node can return from itself

Weigthed Graphs - edges contain values, commmon in working with maps for distance

Adjecency List - List of nodes that are adjacent to a given node
